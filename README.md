## Task description ##

- Implement a recursive [IsPalindromicNumber](PalindromicNumberTask/NumbersExtension.cs#L18) method which determines if the given natural number is a [numeric palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number). *Use arithmetic operations only.*    
- Notes the `Order` and `Timeout` attributes in [unit tests](PalindromicNumberTask.Tests/NumbersExtensionTests.cs).  
- If the runtime (in optimization mode) of the method more than indicate in test methods, determine how long your implementation works. A significant increase of time in the test cases may indicate an ineffective solution.

*Topics - integer operations, recursion.*
