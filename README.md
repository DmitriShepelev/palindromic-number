## Task description ##

Implement a recursive function that determines whether a given four-byte integer is a palindrome (symmetric - read the same way from left to right, and from right to left).   
Please note the **Order** and **Timeout** attributes in unit tests.    
If the runtime (in optimization mode) of the method more than indicate in test methods, determine how long your implementation works. A significant increase of time in the test cases may indicate an ineffective solution.
